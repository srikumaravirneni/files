usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/PyDictionary/utils.py:5: GuessedAtParserWarning: No parser was explicitly specified, so I'm using the best available HTML parser for this system 
("html.parser"). This usually isn't a problem, but if you run this code on another system, or in a different virtual environment, it may use a different parser and behave differently.

The code that caused this warning is on line 5 of the file /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/PyDictionary/utils.py. To get rid of this warning, pass the additional argument 
'features="html.parser"' to the BeautifulSoup constructor.

 return BeautifulSoup(requests.get(url).text)
